GTA PhD Studentship at the University of Leicester. In CARNATION, the candidate will focus on the distribution of computation between classical and quantum machines; the candidate will then focus on distributed encoding, where methods such as Quantum Random Access Codes could be explored to distribute encoded classical input to different quantum machines; alternatively, the candidate could focus on circuit knitting and circuit cutting methods, and identify ways to distribute the computation to optimize for different performance metrics; Also, studying interoperation between quantum hardware nodes and the factors influencing quantum distributed computing will provide a significant contribution, ensuring high-quality research output for the next three-four years and further exploitation.

HPQC project is a collaboration between Vienna University of Technology, University of Innsbruck, Alpine Quantum Technology, IBM Research Zürich (Switzerland), Math.Tec and Johannes Kepler University Linz. The main goal is the integration of quantum technologies inside HPC infrastructure for the execution of scientific computation. As CO-PI, I will focus on the integration of Edge computing in the HPC-Quantum continuum.

SWAIN is a collaboration between Vienna University of Technology (Austria), University of Vienna (Austria), Universita` della Svizzera Italiana (Switzerland), Istanbul Technical University (Turkey), Bogazici University (Turkey), Finnish Environmental Institute (Finland). The main focus of SWAIN is the development of an IT infrastructure for the real-time monitoring of watersheds for the detection of micropollutants. Use cases considered are Ergene river in Turkey and Kokemäenjoki river in Finland. My main responsibility as WP leader is the development of a sustainable monitoring infrastructure based on Edge computing and IoT devices, with objectives as minimization of response time and energy footprint of the infrastructure.

InTraSafEd5G is a collaboration between Vienna University of Technology, City of Vienna, SWARCO and Magenta Telekom, developed in the course of the City of Vienna 5G Use Case Challenge. The main goal was the development of a Cloud/Edge infrastructure to ensure traffic safety at a crossroad, capable to detect critical situations (i.e., pedestrians in drivers’ blind spots) and deliver early warning. The goal has been achieved with the combination of 5G networks, Edge Computing and Deep Learning methodologies. In the scope of this project, I collaborated with project partners together with two master students and a PhD student in all the phases of development and testing of InTraSafEd5G hardware/software infrastructure.

RUCON project is the result of the FWF START grant obtained by prof. Ivona Brandic. The main goal of the project is the development of runtime control for Multi Clouds, with specific focus on interaction between Cloud, Edge and IoT infrastructures. In the scope of this project, I developed novel methodologies for multi-objective offloading of mobile computation considering different trade-offs. I also focused on multi-objective edge infrastructure provisioning, serverless computing and blockchain for reliability at the Edge.
