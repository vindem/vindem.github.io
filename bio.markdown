# Bio
* * *
I am Vincenzo De Maio, a Lecturer in Distributed Systems at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk), School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. My main interests are Quantum Computing, with special focus on Integration of Quantum Computers in HPC, Quantum Machine Learning, and Quantum Optimization, Edge/Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing and Distributed Systems. I am also a member of [HiPEAC](https://www.hipeac.net/#/) and [DISCOVER-US](https://discover-us.eu/#/) networks. 

Since 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [TU Wien](https://tuwien.ac.at). Here I largely developed my scientific career after my PhD, publishing more than 30 peer reviewed papers, including prestigious venues such as ICLR, CCGrid, QCE, Future Generation Computer Systems, eScience, Transactions on Services Computing, and Transactions on Sustainable Computing. I also served as reviewer for different European and National project calls, as well as high-impact journals including [IEEE TCC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6245519), [IEEE TPDS](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/td), [TNSM](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm) and prestigious international conferences in the area of HPC, Distributed Systems, Quantum Computing, and Machine Learning, such as ICLR, ACM Supercomputing, IEEE QCE, IEEE GLOBECOM, IEEE CLOUDCOM, IEEE CLOUD, IEEE EDGE, IEEE IPDPS, IEEE/ACM UCC and IEEE/ACM CCGrid.

I received my Ph.D in Computer Science at the [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at) in November 2016, under the supervision of [Univ. Prof. Dr. Radu Prodan](http://www.itec.aau.at/~radu/) and [Dr. Gabor Kecskemeti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabor-Kecskemeti). My Ph.D. thesis, "Virtual Machine Migration Energy Consumption Simulation in Cloud Computing", is available in the [Resources](/resources/) section of the website. 

My research has been well received by scientific community, as shown by my citation and h-index on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7mZpzzYAAAAJ&hl=en). Also, in the IEEE/ACM UCC 2016 I have been awarded with the Best Paper Award for my work on energy modelling of VM migration, [An improved model for live migration in data centre simulators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2996890.2996892), co-authored with Gabor Kecskemeti and Radu Prodan. Also, my paper "Paving the way to hybrid quantum-classical scientific workflows" received the Elsevier's Fall Editor Choice Award in 2024. More details about my publications can be found on the [Publications](/publications/) section of the website.

I participated in several research projects funded by organizations like [FWF](https://www.fwf.ac.at) (Austrian Science Fund), [FFG](https://www.ffg.at/en) (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) and the italian [PON](https://www.istruzione.it/pon/) (Operative National Program). In 2016, I have been employed by Universitaâ€œ` degli studi di Salerno for the multidisciplinary project [eHealthNet](https://www.ehealthnet.it/progetto-ehealthnet/), that involved collaborations with physiotherapists in the development of a e-health platform for post-hearth surgery rehabilitation. Since 2017, I have been working in different research project, including FWF-START Program project [RUCON](http://rucon.ec.tuwien.ac.at/), City of Vienna [InTraSafEd5G](https://intrasafed.ec.tuwien.ac.at/) and CHIST-ERA [SWAIN](https://www.chistera.eu/projects/swain). In particular, [my work on InTraSafEd5G and SWAIN](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000136176620/kuenstliche-intelligenzwie-die-sicherheit-im-strassenverkehr-und-das-klima-durch) was mentioned on the online version of Der Standard, one of the most widely read newspapers in Austria. Since 2023, I am CO-PI in the FFG Leitprojekt [HPQC](https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/4562957). More details about my research projects experience can be found in the [Projects](/projects/) section of the website.
