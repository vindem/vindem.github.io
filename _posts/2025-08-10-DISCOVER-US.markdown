Since today, I am part of the [DISCOVER-US](https://discover-us.eu/#/) community, which is part of [HiPEAC](https://www.hipeac.net/#/) network. The goal of the DISCOVER-US network is to build active research collaborations between the EU and the US in areas relating to the computing continuum, distributed computing and swarm intelligence.

Looking forward to contribute to the community!
